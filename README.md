## Setup

### Configure the workflow

Specify the action as part of your GitHub actions workflow:

```yml
- name: "Build Changelog"
  id: build_changelog
  uses: mikepenz/release-changelog-builder-action@{latest-release}
  env:
    GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

### Action outputs

After action execution it will return the `changelog` and additional information as step output. You can use it in any follow-up step by referencing the output by referencing it via the id of the step. For example `build_changelog`.

```yml
# ${{steps.{CHANGELOG_STEP_ID}.outputs.changelog}}
${{steps.build_changelog.outputs.changelog}}
```

A full set list of possible output values for this action.

| **Output**            | **Description**                                                                                                           |

| `outputs.fromTag`           | Defines the `fromTag` which describes the lower bound to process pull requests for                                        |
| `outputs.toTag`             | Defines the `toTag` which describes the upper bound to process pull request for                                           |

## Full Sample üñ•Ô∏è

Below is a complete example showcasing how to define a build, which is executed when tagging the project. It consists of:
- Prepare tag, via the GITHUB_REF environment variable
- Build changelog, given the tag
- Create release on GitHub - specifying body with constructed changelog

> Note: PRs will only show up in the changelog if assigned one of the default label categories "feature", "fix" or "test"

```yml
name: 'CI'
on:
  push:
    tags:
      - '*'

jobs:
  release:
    if: startsWith(github.ref, 'refs/tags/')
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Build Changelog
        id: github_release
        uses: meiyanathanj/release-changelog-builder-action@v1
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}

      - name: Create Release
        uses: actions/create-release@v1
        with:
          tag_name: ${{ github.ref }}
          release_name: ${{ github.ref }}
          body: ${{steps.github_release.outputs.changelog}}
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

## Customization üñçÔ∏è

### Note

‚ö†Ô∏è When running this action for non tags trigger the `toTag` will be automatically resolved using the latest tag as retrieved by the git API.

‚ö†Ô∏è The first release tag is a special case since there is no previous release the action can reference to. For this case, there are 2 options:
1. When checking out the source via `git` (E.g.: `actions/checkout`), the action will use the first commit.
2. Create a initial tag on the commit you want to begin a changelog from (for example `v0.0.1`).

üí° By default not specifying `fromTag` or `toTag` will resolve `toTag` from either the `ref` or alternatively fallback to the latest tag from the git API. `fromTag` is resolved by sorting tags using [semver](https://semver.org/). Check the [configuration](#configuration-specification) for alternatives.

### Configuration

The action supports flexible configuration options to modify vast areas of its behavior. To do so, provide the configuration file to the workflow using the `configuration` setting.

```yml
- name: "Build Changelog"
  uses: meiyanathanj/release-changelog-builder-action@{latest-release}
  with:
    configuration: "configuration.json"
  env:
    GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

‚ö†Ô∏è Please note: It is required to have a `checkout` step prior to the changelog step, to allow the action to discover the configuration file.

This configuration is a `.json` file in the following format.

```json
{
    "categories": [
      {
        "title": "## üöÄ Features",
        "labels": ["feature"]
      },
      {
        "title": "## üêõ Fixes",
        "labels": ["fix"]
      },
      {
        "title": "## üß™ Tests",
        "labels": ["test"]
      }
    ],
    "ignore_labels": [
      "ignore"
    ],
    "sort": "ASC",
    "template": "${{CHANGELOG}}\n\n<details>\n<summary>Uncategorized</summary>\n\n${{UNCATEGORIZED}}\n</details>",
    "pr_template": "- ${{TITLE}}\n   - PR: #${{NUMBER}}",
    "empty_template": "- no changes",
    "label_extractor": [
      {
        "pattern": "(.) (.+)",
        "target": "$1",
        "flags": "gu"
      },
      {
        "pattern": "\\[Issue\\]",
        "on_property": "title",
        "method": "match"
      }
    ],
    "duplicate_filter": {
      "pattern": "\\[ABC-....\\]",
      "on_property": "title",
      "method": "match"
    },
    "transformers": [
      {
        "pattern": "[\\-\\*] (\\[(...|TEST|CI|SKIP)\\])( )?(.+?)\n(.+?[\\-\\*] )(.+)",
        "target": "- $4\n  - $6"
      }
    ],
    "max_tags_to_fetch": 200,
    "max_pull_requests": 200,
    "max_back_track_time_days": 365,
    "exclude_merge_branches": [
      "Owner/qa"
    ],
    "tag_resolver": {
      "method": "semver",
      "filter": {
        "pattern": "api-(.+)",
        "flags": "gu"
      }
    },
    "base_branches": [
      "dev"
    ]
}
```

Any section of the configuration can be omitted to have defaults apply.

üí° `ignore_labels` take precedence over category labels, allowing to specifically exclude certain PRs.

Defaults for the configuration can be found in the [configuration.ts](https://github.com/mikepenz/release-changelog-builder-action/blob/develop/src/configuration.ts)

Please see the [Configuration Specification](#configuration-specification) for detailed descriptions on the offered configuration options.

### Advanced workflow specification

For advanced use cases additional settings can be provided to the action
